## Description
Summary: This GitHub project focuses on developing AI-powered anti-ransomware bots.

The goal of these bots is to automatically generate code that can detect, neutralize, and remove ransomware threats from computer systems. By leveraging machine learning and real-time threat analysis, the bots can quickly identify unusual behavior patterns associated with ransomware. They then respond by isolating the affected files, stopping the malicious process, and restoring any compromised data from backups. This proactive approach helps protect users and organizations from the damaging effects of ransomware attacks, making data recovery faster and reducing potential losses.
